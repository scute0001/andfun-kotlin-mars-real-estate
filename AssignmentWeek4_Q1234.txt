1. What is ​Polymorphism​? Try to explain in Mandarin.
​Polymorphism 多型，可提供讓不同的子類別用不同的方式實做同一個function。
可以讓各個物件用最適合的function呼叫。
Ex: 動物類別內有"叫"function， 人 / 貓 / 狗 都繼承動物類別所以也可以使用"叫"function，
多型可以讓人 / 貓 / 狗 各自實做改寫"叫"function的內容產生合適的叫聲。


2. Here are the 7 important lifecycle methods of an ​Activity​:
Try to explain when are they called during the lifecycle of Activity.

i.onCreate() -> OnCreate is called when the activity is created and initialized.

ii.onStart() -> OnStart is called when the activity becomes visible.

iii.onResume() -> OnResume is called when the activity has focus.

iv.onPause() -> OnPause is called when the activity loses focus.

v.onStop() -> OnStop is called when the activity goes off screen.

vi.onDestroy() -> OnDestroy is called once when the activity is fully destroyed.

*onRestart -> OnRestart is called if app was already created and return to use after onStop() step.
              Anything that runs only if not being created.

    
3. What is the ​Android Jetpack​?

Android Jetpack is a suite of tools, documentation, and libraries.
To help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, 
and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices 
so that developers can focus on the code they care about.

it content:
1. Foundation: AppCompat, Android KTX, Multidex, Test.
2. Architecture: Data Binding, Lifecycles, LiveData, Navigation, Room, ViewModel, WorkManager, Paging.
3. Behavior: Animation & Transitions, Auto/TV/Wear, Emoji, Fragment, Layout, Palette.
4. UI: Download Manager, Media & Playback, Permissions, Norifications, Sharing, Slices.



4. What is ​Coroutines​? Why we use it? Try to explain in Mandarin.

Coroutine 可以使程式允許多執行序，在Main thread已經有function執行時
可以指派其他function與main同時執行。

因為在Android main thread中，例如如果有個執行順序
function(A) >> function(B) >> function(C)，如果function A的執行時間過長，
會造成 Main thread 被function(A)占用，而 B,C要等到A結束後才能執行，
這會造成android畫面被blocked住，輕則影響使用者體驗，嚴重的話
如果停住超過5秒，甚至會出現"Application Not Responding" (ANR) error。
